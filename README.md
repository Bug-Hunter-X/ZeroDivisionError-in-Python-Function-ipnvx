# Python ZeroDivisionError Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in an exception.

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function that handles the potential for division by zero using exception handling.
